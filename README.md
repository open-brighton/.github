# 🌱 OpenBrighton

**Open source technology for a better Brighton, NY.**  
Building digital tools that make life easier, more accessible, inclusive, and more connected — powered by volunteers, neighbors, and local engineers.

## 🎯 Mission

OpenBrighton is a community-led, open source initiative to improve access to public services and civic information in Brighton, NY. From notifications about yard debris pickup to AI-powered guides for permits, we’re exploring how modern, ethical technology can serve residents of all ages and backgrounds.

This project is **not affiliated with or sponsored by the Town of Brighton**. We are an independent group of residents, volunteers, and technologists working in the public interest.

## 🚀 Our First Project: Yard Debris Notifications

No more wondering if you missed pickup day.

We’re creating a simple tool that will let you sign up to get alerts — via email or SMS — when yard debris pickup is scheduled for your address or neighborhood.

- Friendly reminders, right on time  
- Privacy-first: no tracking or logins required  
- Open source, free to use, and built with love

We don’t pretend to know all the ways tech could help — that’s why we’d love to hear from you.

Some ideas we’ve heard already:
- AI chatbot to answer town service questions in plain English  
- Meeting summaries with automatic highlights and decisions  
- Interactive map of local construction, services, and events  
- Volunteer skill directory to help neighbors help neighbors

If it helps residents, reduces frustration, or makes civic life more welcoming — we want to hear about it.
